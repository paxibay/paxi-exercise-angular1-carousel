Given a JSONP data feed (http://static.globalnews.ca/content/test/results-2011.js) containing the election results for 10 ridings,
display them in a carousel presentation that a user can rotate through to view all the results.  
There should be right and left arrows that users can click to “flip” through all of the 10 riding “cards”.

Each riding “card” should display the name of the riding and the ordered list of the candidates for
that riding with their vote totals and percentage of the total vote. The winner of the riding should  
also be highlighted.  The listing for each candidate should incorporate the color of their party 
(red for Liberal, blue for PC, orange for NDP, green for Green and grey for any other party)
